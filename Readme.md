This is __skeleton code__ for **simple ReactNative Calculator**
This is provided for ReactNative Study of *HeXA* at 2017.05 ~ ?
I assume you already have build **every circumstances** for ReactNative


# Install
> 1. __react-native init *ProjectName*__
> 2. __cd *ProjectName*__
> 3. overwrite __index.android.js__ file (It means just copy and paste and press yes to overwrite)
> 4. start AVD or Geny motion or anything for simulation(debugging)
> 5. __react-native run-android__

# Tips  
You have to build functions, styles and so on. you can design your own calculator.
You also can change the skeleton
  
Good Luck! :)
