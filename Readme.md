This is __skeleton code__ for **simple ReactNative Calculator**
This is provided for ReactNative Study of *HeXA* at 2017.05 ~ ?
I assume you already have build **every circumstances** for ReactNative


- Install
1. "react-native init * Project Name *"
2. "cd * Project Name *"
3. overwrite __index.android.js__ file (It means just copy and paste and press yes to overwrite)
4. start AVD or Geny motion or anything for simulation(debugging)
5. "react-native run-android"

- Tips
You have to build functions, styles and so on. you can design your own calculator.
You also can change the skeleton

Good Luck! :)
